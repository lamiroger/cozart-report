Some of the tasks executed since the last report 

The old circulation pump that was located in the gym has been dismounted and I find out that the compasants have been damaged by overheating. 
That happens when a pump is running too long without water.
I did data entering in the FIIX system on circulation pumps(add) and updated water shutdown procedure to include unknown circulation pump 

Dismount Christmas decoration and stored them 

Staircase heavy cleaning located emergency East side at P2 level , sand was accumulated from the car wash drain canal for years.

P2 cleanout cover sinking on P2. I cleaned  out traps, to build a scope of work and budget , search for parts and other resources needed to complete the project .
I cutted and layout plywood plank to cover drain cleanout access that we are planning to fix  

Intercom was offline for a couple of hours, our service provider for our Mircom phone access system was out of town and I resetted the panel.
Since then the phone access panel is working better. I am working to install the Mircom software to manage the intercom on our laptop. I did that installation successfully before for another building 

I dismounted the portable transfer pump used for transfert glycol from baril to the system (chiller or heating). The pump was seized in the rust and now the parts are moving freely. I have not tested the pump yet but that pump is advanced and maybe still working.

The garage door was offline for most of the afternoon Friday January 29, 2021. The problem was the drive belt failure, I reported that problem months ago 
with also the cable coming at the end of his life expectancy. No belt was available on site to fix it and at that time ,even if I had the belt I may not have had the garage working properly. All Kind Door Services Ltd fixed the problem finally, that was not an easy fix as the belt size was different. The size change with some brand Now I have in stock two potential  sizes(B29 , B30) that we may need it in the future.FYI, they are attached to the garage door electric switch beside the garage door on 
p1. 

Tenant from 304 was complaining regarding the heating system making strong fluid noise, I turned off one of both heating circulation pumps and now the noise is acceptable. 703 owners mentioned that problem last winter and  we should have enough heat capacity with one pump running .  

I replaced the 101 unit toilet tank lever that we cannot find in Home depot or Lowes, only wholesale  plumbing  has it  in stock .

       

 

waiting for answer :
new:

add a LED Car wash lights (coat lest of <$140) .

According to PFP plumber, the heating system is less important than the chiller regarding having glycoll in the system. Rust Inhibitor will increase PH of the system if the PH is too low. The citer water is already at PH 8 according to internet search. 

Old:

Add Glycol to the Chiller system. We already have 600- 700 liter of Glycol in stock , enough to fill the chiller system . We need to add a rust inhibitor in the chiller and boiler loop.


Need to replace  the door handle on the  door (going from mailbox area  to 101 hallway), generator room, roof and sprinkler room . All last three are difficult to open and very old . Probably less than $400 .65- 85 each. That is something I did in the building .

Need the replace the garage door cables 

Install  a defibrillator close  the  fire panel and buy a First Aid Kit
