Some of the tasks executed: end of November to now 

Fixed and restarted the wall heating unit in the lobby south entrance 
Installed parkade light cages.
Repaired and upgraded  to LED Car wash lights  .
I did some  tidying , disposed of  old junk  in the building  boiler room , gaz room , car wash room.
Termined light   LED   upgrade  in emergency EAST staircase and boiler room .
Paint Touch up and cleaned halfway.
Replaced the rinse tank car wash valve  with a new improved model and we have reduced the water in the rinse tank for improving longevity.
Drained the chiller , refilled it and drained again, now the chiller system is empty of water. 
uncloged  403 fan coil pipe.
Removed the cover from recycling bin .
Prevented one catastrophe by blocking  the front car driveway  to pedestrian  as big pieces of ice was failing  from the 1103 -1102 after snow storm.    

Recommendation:
1.Add Glycol to the Chiller system. We already have 600- 700 liter of Glycol in stock , enough to fill the chiller system . We need to add a rust inhibitor in the chiller and boiler loop.
2 Need to replace  the door handle on the  door (going from mailbox area  to 101 hallway), generator room, roof and sprinkler room . All last three are difficult to open and very old . Probably less than $400 .65- 85 each. That is something I did in the building .
3. change   three carwash light covers  and add  one more  water resistant light fixture.
4. Install  a defibrillator close  the  fire panel and buy a First Aid Kit
