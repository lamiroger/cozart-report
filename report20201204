Lobby Break in 
On the November 6, 2020 I received a call from GoSmart regarding the front door not closing properly after 10pm. 
I went at the Cozart immediately and fixed the door.
During the week after I received the video, produced the report and I shared it with the Calgary Police.

Boiler hot water
From the latest water treatment analysis we learned that we have to add chemical to boiler and Chiller system.
Michael and GoSmart are working on it to find the solution.

Parkdale ramp
A recent conversation with Ian Kenny from Durwest gave a price range of recoating the ramp at $8 000 or wait till the rust 
affect the ramp heating system and his last quotation on that type of repair was $90 000.
